Load Data:

Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame (e.g., diabetes.csv).
Data Preprocessing:

Split the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (Y).
Split the data further into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% for training and 20% for testing).
Model Initialization:

Initialize the KNN classifier with a chosen value for k (number of nearest neighbors). In the given code, k = 5.
Model Training:

Train the KNN classifier on the training data (X_train, Y_train).
Prediction:

Use the trained KNN model to predict the target variable (Y_test) for the test set (X_test).
Evaluation Metrics:

Compute evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance:
Confusion Matrix: Displays the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative values.
Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions over total predictions.
Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made.
Recall: The proportion of true positives out of all actual positives in the dataset.
Error Rate: The proportion of incorrect predictions.
Accuracy for Different k:

Check the accuracy of the model for different values of k (e.g., from 1 to 10).
Re-train the model with each value of k and evaluate the accuracy to find the best k value.
Manual Distance Calculation:

(Optional) Calculate the Euclidean distance manually between two data points as an exercise in understanding how KNN works at a low level.
Use the formula for Euclidean distance:
root summation i-n xi-yi^2
  xi yi are the feature values of the two points being compared.
